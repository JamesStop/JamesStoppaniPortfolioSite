## Unsolved problems

I wanted to add some extra interactive elements (header that starts at full screen, etc.), as well as some better cloud images for aesthetic preferences. The first issue had worked in a previous version, after some changes I realized it no longer worked the same way and would need more messing with than before. As for the second thing, finding good cloud pngs using opacity and clear backgrounds would require me to either make them myself or find an artist for a commission as finding good free alternatives proved very difficult.
